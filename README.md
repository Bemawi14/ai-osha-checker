# AI OSHA Checker

> An open-source tool that uses AI to determine whether a workplace incident should be reported to OSHA based on the user's uploaded documents.

## 🚀 Overview

AI OSHA Checker is designed to help safety managers, compliance officers, and HR personnel quickly assess whether a workplace incident is OSHA-reportable. The tool uses AI and rule-based logic to analyze incident reports, identify key criteria (like hospitalization, amputations, fatalities, etc.), and make a recommendation.

## ⚙️ Features

- Upload incident reports (PDF, DOCX, or plain text)
- AI-powered analysis of the document content
- OSHA reportability recommendation
- Privacy-first: no data is stored
